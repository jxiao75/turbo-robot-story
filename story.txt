Once upon a time there was a little cat named git. Git lived in a big house
on the moon and ate fat mice engorged on that delicious moon cheese. 
The moon belonged to the nearby inhabited planet named Dearth, a planet said to be teaming with mice
that were the fattest of them all due to the scrumptious, thick cuts of cheese that naturally formed on Dearth.
Git decided his time on the moon had come to an end and decided to travel to Dearth in search of the fabled mice.
Git's journey was not easy - he face many perils. From meatball asteroids, the Cow Collective (the galaxies most ruthless cheese dealers), and even pirates, hit took Git many months to travel to Dearth. When he made it, he found a world untouched by the Cow Collective, with enough cheese and juicy mice to feed him and a million other cats for a millenia.
