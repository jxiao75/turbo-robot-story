Once upon a time there was a little cat named git. Git lived in a big house
on the moon and ate fat mice engorged on that delicious moon cheese. 
The moon belonged to the nearby inhabited planet named Dearth, a planet said to be teaming with mice
that were the fattest of them all due to the scrumptious, thick cuts of cheese that naturally formed on Dearth.
Git decided his time on the moon had come to an end and decided to travel to Dearth in search of the fabled mice.
